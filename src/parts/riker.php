<p>This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I am your worst nightmare! You enjoyed that. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. How long can two people talk about nothing? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Well, that's certainly good to know. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Your head is not an artifact! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. and attack the Romulans. Damage report!</p>
